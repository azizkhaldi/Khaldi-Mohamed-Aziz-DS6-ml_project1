## üöÄ Overview
**Khaldi Mohamed Aziz DS6 ML_Project1** is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to support:  
- Scalable model deployment  
- Real-time inference  
- Robust monitoring of predictive models  

It integrates API communication, model management, and automated deployment into a unified architecture.  

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **API Gateway**: A Flask-based proxy server that enables seamless communication between client applications and backend models.  
- **Model Management**: Tools for training, serializing, and deploying models with artifacts and environment configurations.  
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker setup with FastAPI and Uvicorn for scalable, consistent API hosting.  
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Elasticsearch and Kibana integrations for centralized logging and real-time system insights.  
- **Automation & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows and Makefiles to automate testing and deployment.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete orchestration of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and continuous integration with MLflow and Beatsstack.
